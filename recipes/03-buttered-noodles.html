			<h2>Buttered Noodles</h2>
			<p>
				Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either
				as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan
				cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy,
				kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could
				be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get
				many questions on how to make it.
			</p>
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Noodles: </strong>This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles,
					but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to
					spaghetti.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Butter: </strong>You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since
					you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted
					(depending on your taste, of course).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Parmesan: </strong>Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a
					notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can
					leave it out if you want.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Salt and Pepper: </strong>Finish off this easy buttered
					noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
